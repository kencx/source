Hi I'm Ken. I've built some [projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}}), maintain my own
[homelab]({{< ref "/tags/homelab/" >}}) and occasionally [write about stuff]({{<
ref "/notes" >}}) I learnt. I also enjoy indie games, [keyboards]({{< ref
"/tags/keyboards/"
>}}) and filling up my ever-expanding reading list.

[Colophon]({{< ref "colophon.md" >}})
