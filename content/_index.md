I'm a junior software engineer based in Singapore. I'm familiar with Python, Go,
Java and Linux systems.

I enjoy selfhosting and am constantly finding new ways to optimize my workflow.
Oftentimes, at the expense of [productivity](https://xkcd.com/1319). In my spare
time, I enjoy indie games, [keyboards]({{< ref "/notes/keyboards/planck.md" >}}) and tinkering with tech.

This is a site for my personal notes, most of which are related to dev and
devops. They might be useful or incredibly niche. Read more about that
[here]({{< ref "/posts/hello-world.md" >}}).

Find me at [Github](https://github.com/kencx).
