I'm a junior DevOps engineer based in Singapore.

I enjoy technology, selfhosting and finding new ways to optimize my workflow.
Oftentimes, this comes at the expense of my [productivity](https://xkcd.com/1319).
In my spare time, I enjoy indie games, [keyboards]({{< ref
"/notes/keyboards/planck.md" >}}) and tinkering with tech.

This is a site for my personal notes, most of which are related to dev and
devops. They might be useful or incredibly niche. Read more about that
[here]({{< ref "/posts/hugo-serve.md" >}}).
