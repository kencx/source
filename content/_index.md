I am a junior DevOps engineer based in Singapore. I am responsible for managing,
maintaining and monitoring internal Linux systems. I am familiar with Python and
Go, and try my best to automate my job away. In my spare time, I enjoy indie
games, building [keyboards]({{< ref "/tags/keyboards/"
>}}) and selfhosting. I collect notes of various dev and devops topics here.

## Projects

### Hubble Homelab

[Hubble](https://github.com/kencx/homelab-iac) is a private, on-prem homelab
hosted on Proxmox with the design goals:
- Infrastructure as code
- Immutable infrastructure
- Automated provisioning and bootstrapping with CI/CD
- Zero trust security
- Automated backups

I use this home server to self-host useful services, and continuously experiment
and learn different development and infrastructure tools.

### Cloud Resume Challenge

A static [site](https://resume.cheo.dev) with a visitor counter built with AWS
services. It is fully managed with Terraform and code changes are deployed
automatically with CI/CD. More information [here](https://github.com/kencx/cloudresumechallenge).

### dotfiles

A collection of my [dotfiles](https://github.com/kencx/dotfiles) and custom
scripts I've amassed.
