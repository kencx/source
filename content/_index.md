I'm a junior engineer based in Singapore, responsible for maintaining
and monitoring internal Linux systems.

I'm familiar with Python, Go, Ansible and Terraform. I also have a Physics
degree but decided working in IT was more fun. You can find me on
[Github](https://github.com/kencx) or take a look at my [projects]({{< ref
"/projects/" >}}).

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering on my
[homelab]({{< ref "/tags/homelab/" >}}), indie games, building [keyboards]({{<
ref "/tags/keyboards/"
>}}) and filling up my ever-expanding reading list.

## Context

This site is a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), for

guaranteed to be accurate, but I try my best to ensure its well-researched and
