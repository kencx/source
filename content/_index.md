This site is my personal [digital
garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), personal knowledge base and
sometimes a blog. It is an entire site dedicated to my journey of [learning in
public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) as a new[ish] engineer.

The key topics resolve around devops, development and Unix systems
administration. These might change with time. All information here is transient
and represents my knowledge at that time. I don't guarantee that all information
is accurate, but I try my best to ensure its well-researched and referenced.
Incomplete documents will be flagged.

Any constructive criticism is welcome. Contact me at the links below.

### About Me

I'm a junior engineer based in Singapore, responsible for managing, maintaining
and monitoring internal Linux systems. I do my best to automate my job away.

I'm familiar with Python and Go, haven't touched Java in awhile and am ~~trying
to~~ learn[ing] Haskell. I also have a Physics degree but decided working in IT
was more fun. You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/kencx) or take a
look at my [projects]({{< ref "/projects/" >}}).

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering on my
[homelab]({{< ref "/tags/homelab/" >}}), indie games, building [keyboards]({{<
ref "/tags/keyboards/"
>}}) and filling up my ever-expanding reading list.
