I'm based in Singapore, and working as a junior engineer. You can find me on
[Github](https://github.com/kencx) or take a look at my [projects]({{< ref
"/projects/" >}}). In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering on my [homelab]({{< ref
"/tags/homelab/" >}}), indie games, building [keyboards]({{< ref
"/tags/keyboards/"
>}}) and filling up my ever-expanding reading list.

## Colophon

This site is my attempt for [learning in
public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). All information represents
my knowledge at that time and is not guaranteed to be accurate, but I
try my best to ensure its researched and referenced. Incomplete documents
will be flagged.  Any constructive criticism is welcome.

- Notes are sorted alphabetically with a "last edited" date
- Blog posts are sorted chronologically by the date they are first posted and appended
  with a "last edited" date.
- Some documents are incomplete and will be flagged as such. Take these with a
  grain of salt.
- A site-wide search engine is _coming soon_.

### Software

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on
[Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). The full source code is available on
[Github](https://github.com/kencx/source). The theme is adapted from [Bamboo
CSS](https://rilwis.github.io/bamboo/).

My preferred text editor is [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and I use
[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to organize my notes before publishing some
of them here.
