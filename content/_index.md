I'm a junior engineer based in Singapore, responsible for managing, maintaining
and monitoring internal Linux systems. I do my best to automate my job away.

I'm familiar with Python and Go, haven't touched Java in awhile and am ~~trying to~~
learn[ing] Haskell. I also have a Physics degree but decided working in IT was more fun.
Find me on [Github](https://github.com/kencx) or take a look at my [projects]({{< ref
"/projects/" >}}).

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering on my
[homelab]({{< ref "/tags/homelab/" >}}), indie games, building [keyboards]({{<
ref "/tags/keyboards/"
>}}) and filling up my ever-expanding reading list. I collect notes of various
dev and devops topics here.

As a new[ish] engineer, I do my best to not make too many mistakes. Let me know
you if spot any.
