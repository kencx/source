I'm a junior ~~DevOps engineer~~ sysadmin based in Singapore.

I enjoy technology, selfhosting and finding new ways to optimize my workflow,
usually at the expense of my [productivity](https://xkcd.com/1319). In my spare
time, I enjoy indie games, [keyboards]({{< ref "/tags/keyboards/" >}}) and
tinkering with tech.

This is a site for my personal notes, most of which are related to dev and
devops. They might be useful or incredibly niche. Read more about that
[here]({{< ref "/posts/hugo-serve.md" >}}).

## Projects

### Hubble Homelab

[Hubble](https://github.com/kencx/homelab-iac) is a private, on-prem homelab
hosted on Proxmox. Its design goals are:
- Infrastructure as code
- Immutable infrastructure
- Automated provisioning and bootstrapping with CI/CD
- Zero trust security
- Automated backups

I use this home server to self-host useful services, and continuously experiment
and learn different development and infrastructure tools.

### Cloud Resume Challenge

A static [site](https://resume.cheo.dev) with a visitor counter built with AWS
services. It is fully managed with Terraform and code changes are deployed
automatically with CI/CD.

More info [here](https://github.com/kencx/cloudresumechallenge).

### dotfiles

A collection of my [dotfiles](https://github.com/kencx/dotfiles) and custom
scripts I've amassed.
