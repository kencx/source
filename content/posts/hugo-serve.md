This site is a place to store various best practices and personal projects
related to work and my interests - a [personal knowledge
base](https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/reports/t722h9830). It might consist
of topics in programming, DevOps automation, Physics or anything else I'm
interested in at the moment.

I decided to start putting this online as a means of consolidating my notes. It
might be helpful to others, or at the very least, motivate me to continue
learning. And its also fun.

Hopefully, this site will continue to be maintained and become a useful
resource. If you are someone else reading this, I hope you might have at least
taken away something of value.
