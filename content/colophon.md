This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on
[Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). The source code is hosted on
[Github](https://github.com/kencx/source) and automatically deployed via Github
Actions with every new change.

The theme is a modified Jekyll theme [Dark
Reader](https://github.com/sharadcodes/jekyll-theme-dark-reader) which I ported
to Hugo and tweaked to my linking. The colorscheme is inspired by [Gruvbox
Dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) and
[kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim), and the font is
[FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

The site aims to be lightweight, responsive and secure. It has no tracking,
little to no JavaScript and is inspired by
[bettermotherfuckingwebsite](https://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/).

## Structure

The site is first and foremost a [personal knowledge base]({{< ref
"/posts/hugo-serve" >}}), and second a blog. It aims to store my notes and
information in a [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/)
like manner. It is also a place for me to discuss and share my interests,
whatever they may be at the time.
