All information represents my knowledge at that time and is not guaranteed to be
accurate, but I try my best to ensure its researched and referenced. Incomplete
documents will be flagged. Any constructive criticism is welcome.

- Notes are sorted alphabetically with a "last edited" date
- Blog posts are sorted chronologically by the date they are first posted and appended
  with a "last edited" date.
- Some documents are incomplete and will be flagged as such.
- A site-wide search engine is probably _coming soon_.

### Software

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on a
[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) server behind Caddy. The full source code is
available on [Github](https://github.com/kencx/source) and DNS is hosted on
Cloudflare.

The theme is adapted from [Bamboo
CSS](https://rilwis.github.io/bamboo/) and the font is [IBM Plex
Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex). All icons are obtained from
[feathericons](https://feathericons.com).

I write my notes using a combination of [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and
[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). You can find my dotfiles
[here](https://github.com/kencx/dotfiles).
