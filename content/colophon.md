This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on
[Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). The source code is hosted on
[Github](https://github.com/kencx/source) and automatically deployed via Github
Actions with every new change.

The theme is a modified Jekyll theme [Dark
Reader](https://github.com/sharadcodes/jekyll-theme-dark-reader) which I ported
to Hugo and tweaked to my liking. The colorscheme is inspired by [Gruvbox
Dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) and
[kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim), and the font is Nimbus Sans and
[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

The site aims to be lightweight, responsive and secure. It has no tracking,
little to no JavaScript and borrows from
[bettermotherfuckingwebsite](https://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/).

<!-- Finally, this site is built entirely with -->
<!-- [IndieWeb's](https://indieweb.org/principles) principles in mind. -->

## Structure

The site is first and foremost a [digital garden or personal knowledge base]({{< ref
"/posts/hugo-serve" >}}), and second a blog. All information here represent my known
knowledge, thoughts and interests at the time. I don't guarantee information here is
accurate, but I try my best to ensure that it is well-researched and referenced.

Information is also transient and always updated when I receive new knowledge:
- Blog posts are sorted chronologically by the date they are first posted and appended
  with a "last edited" date.
- Notes are sorted alphabetically with a "last edited" date


## Software

My preferred text editor is [neovim](https://neovim.io/) on
[st](https://github.com/kencx/st) terminal. I use
[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes and write drafts before
publishing some of them here.
