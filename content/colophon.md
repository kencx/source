This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on
[Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). The source code is hosted on
[Github](https://github.com/kencx/source) and automatically deployed via Github
Actions with every new change.

The theme is a modified Jekyll theme [Dark
Reader](https://github.com/sharadcodes/jekyll-theme-dark-reader) which I ported
to Hugo and tweaked to my liking. The colorscheme is inspired by [Gruvbox
Dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) and
[kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim), and the font is Nimbus Sans and
[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

The site aims to be lightweight, responsive and secure. It has no tracking,
little to no JavaScript and borrows from
[bettermotherfuckingwebsite](https://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/).

## Structure
- Notes are sorted alphabetically with a "last edited" date
- Blog posts are sorted chronologically by the date they are first posted and appended
  with a "last edited" date.
- Some documents are incomplete and will be flagged as such. Take these with a
  grain of salt.
- A site-wide search engine is _coming soon_.

## Software

My preferred text editor is [neovim](https://neovim.io/) on
[st](https://github.com/kencx/st) terminal. I use
[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes and write drafts before
publishing some of them here.
