The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on
[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/). The full source code is
available on [Github](https://github.com/kencx/source). The theme is adapted
from [Bamboo CSS](https://rilwis.github.io/bamboo/) and the font is [IBM Plex
Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex). All icons are obtained from
[feathericons](https://feathericons.com).

I write my notes using a combination of [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and
[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). You can find my dotfiles
[here](https://github.com/kencx/dotfiles).
