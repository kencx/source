# Hugo Source Code
This repo contains the source code for my [kencx.github.io](site) built by
Hugo

This is a modified Jekyll theme [Dark
Reader](https://github.com/sharadcodes/jekyll-theme-dark-reader) that was ported
over to Hugo

Commits pushed to this repository are deployed to
`kencx/kencx.github.io` automatically.
Refer to [this article](https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/create-a-website-with-hugo-and-gh/) for reference on deployment with Hugo and Github Pages.
